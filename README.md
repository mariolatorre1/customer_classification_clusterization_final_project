# Customer Classification/Clusterization Project

## Online Travel Company

This is my Github repository for the IronHack Data Analytics bootcamp final project.

I use data from a customer insights survey for the UK market to apply machine learning and classify respondents 
according to how much they are willing to spend on a weekend trip for two, and also to cluster users in order to 
understand their similar characteristics and behaviors.
